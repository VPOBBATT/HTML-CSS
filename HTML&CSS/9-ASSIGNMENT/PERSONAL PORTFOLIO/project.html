            <p>Students often get the opportunity to listen to the eminent professors, industry<br>
                specialists, and experts from different sectors. The guest lectures organised at MGM <br>
                college were extremely helpful in deepening the understanding of the current <br>
                technology trends. The loop is closed by giving feedback to the guests in order them to<br>
                know how useful their knowledge sharing was and how important it was for the students to <br>
                interact with them. Recognizing the importance of digital feedback, Vijaya Lakshmi<br>
                developed an application using HTMl,CSS,PHp and MySQL.
